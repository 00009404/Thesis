# Thesis / Game Description
My final year project is an educational Augmented Reality game for children who want to learn the names of basic musical instruments
in three languages, such as English, Russian and Uzbek. Special flashcards with pictures of musical instruments are used to play this game.
The game has the following features:
- Tracking 2D real-world images of flashcards and overlaying 3D animated musical instruments on them.
- Playing the instrument's name once the image is detected.
- Playing the audio with instrument's sound when the virtual object is touched.
- Taking a screenshot of the virtual musical instrument by pressing the camera button.
- Scaling and rotating the 3D objects to take a closer look at.
